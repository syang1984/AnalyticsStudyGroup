#### Goals

The group's main intent is to develop analytical skills within R and Rstudio environment in preparation to start a consultation service.

##### Data Skill Core Goals

* Basic Scripting
* Basic Data Mining
* Basic Statistical Analysis
* Basic Data Visualization
* Basic Application Development

##### Consultation Service Goals

* Build Analytical Portfolio
* Develop Potential Clients List
* Soft Launch - June 2020


#### Expectations:

1. Monthly Meeting - 2nd Saturdays.
    + Corresponds with monthly R MeetUp Group
2. Meetings last for two to two and half hours.
3. Meetings to be held at JOCO Public Library (Lenexa Branch)
    + 8778 Penrose Ln, Lenexa, KS 66219
4. All must bring their own laptops.
    + Borrow laptop from library if needed.
5. Assignments Completed before each meeting.
6. Rotating presenters.


#### Meeting Notes

##### Lesson 2: Secret Santa List Cont.

Additional parameters:

1. Matching list (gift recipient list) cannot be manually created.
2. Expand list to 14 individuals.
3. No one should buy for their own significant other.
    + 5 couples
4. Build in avoidance possibility.
    + 3 sets avoidance
5. Fixed individual (someone who already bought their gifts for an individual)
    + 1 fixed set
    
    
##### Couples

Carla | Chris

Louis | Jessica

Leslie | Ben

Mitch | Cameron

Jim | Pam

##### Single

Dwight

Jeremy

Ray

Andy

##### Frenemies (Will not buy gifts for each other)

Dwight | Jim

Leslie | Jeremy

Louis | Ray

##### Fixed Set (must match with one another)

Chris | Carla

##### Strategic Approach

1. Create a dataframe to house all the individuals.
2. Create set parameters
    + Participants
    + Self
    + Couples
    + Set Gifts
    + Frenemies
3. Create variables for testing parameters.
4. Randomize list for givers to match receivers.
5. Loop list until all parameters are met.
6. Create final list.

##### Final List

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, error=F, message=F}

library(tidyverse)

na.zero <- function (x) {
    x[is.na(x)] <- 0
    return(x)
}

DF = tibble(Names = c('Carla', 'Chris', 'Louis', 'Jessica', 'Leslie', 'Ben', 'Mitch', 'Cameron', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'Dwight', 'Jeremy', 'Ray', 'Andy'))

    mutate(GR = .$Names) %>% 
    left_join(CP, by = c("Names" = "C1")) %>% 
    left_join(CP, by = c("Names" = "C2")) %>%

    mutate(Test2 = ifelse(Receiver == C1, 1, 0)) %>% 
    mutate(Test3 = ifelse(Receiver == F1, 1, 0)) %>% 
    mutate(Test4 = ifelse(Receiver == F2, 1, 0)) %>%
    mutate(Test5 = ifelse(Receiver == GR, 1, 0)) %>% 
    na.zero() %>% 
    mutate(Final_Test = (if_else(Test1 == 1 | Test2 == 1 | Test3 == 1 | Test4 == 1 | Test5 == 1, 1, 0)))

    #sum(Pre_SS$Final_Test)

 if (sum(Pre_SS$Final_Test) == 0) {Final = Pre_SS; break}
}

Secret_Santa = bind_rows(Secret_Santa,select(Final,2:1))

Secret_Santa


```

##### Homework

1. Rewrite code in Tidyverse
    + David to write randomizer code
2. Add randomizer cost of gift (up $100) and date (first 5 days of december)
3. Plot the days of gifts purchases and cost.
    + Present data in three different visual formats
    
##### Next Meeting

Jan 18 @ TBD
