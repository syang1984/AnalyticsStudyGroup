##### Lesson 1: Secret Santa List

What is a secret Santa list?

Blind list of individuals for gift exchange. Blind list in this instance are individuals are matched to one another for gift exchange. This is a non-bidirectional list. Matchers (Gift Bearers) are aware of their matches (Gift Recipient), but matchees are unaware of their matchers.

Basic secret Santa list rules:

1. Individuals cannot match to themselves.


Creating a secret Santa list:

1. Create list of individuals

* David
* Heather
* Thanh
* Peng
* Steve
* Eric

```{r}
c("David", "Heather", "Thanh", "Peng", "Steve", "Eric")
```

2. Create a list:

```{r}
p = c("David", "Heather", "Thanh", "Peng", "Steve", "Eric")
```


3. Create a matching list:
```{r}
v = c("Heather", "Thanh", "Peng", "Steve", "Eric","David")
```

4. Create matrix to house list:

```{r}
mp = matrix(p)
mv = matrix(v)
```

5. Combine matrix to create combined list:
```{r}
cbind(mp,mv)
```
